## Features
- No need root permission

## Compatability
Python 3.6+ is required.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tor-proxy
```

## Quickstart

1. Import with ```from tor_proxy import tor_proxy``` .
2. call function `tor_proxy()` , store as variable and give it as port argument in proxies.

```python
# tor_proxy_example.py
from tor_proxy import tor_proxy
import requests

port = tor_proxy()

http_proxy  = f"socks5h://127.0.0.1:{port}"
https_proxy = f"socks5h://127.0.0.1:{port}"

proxies = { 
              "http"  : http_proxy, 
              "https" : https_proxy, 
            }

url = "https://api.ipify.org"

r = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies)

print(r.text)
```

## Command Line Usage

After installing, you can run the Tor proxy service directly from the command line:

```bash
tor-proxy
```

This will start the Tor SOCKS proxy and print the port it is running on.

```sh
$ tor-proxy
connecting_to_tor: 100% - Done
Tor SOCKS proxy running on port: 47863
```

### Additional Command Line Options

- Run as a background (detached) process:

  ```bash
  tor-proxy --detach
  ```
  This will start the Tor proxy in the background.

- Kill all running Tor processes started with `/usr/bin/tor -f /tmp/...`:

  ```bash
  tor-proxy --kill
  ```
  This will find and terminate all matching Tor processes.

Now you can use this port as proxy in code.

```python
# tor_proxy_example.py
import requests

port = 47863

http_proxy  = f"socks5h://127.0.0.1:{port}"
https_proxy = f"socks5h://127.0.0.1:{port}"

proxies = { 
              "http"  : http_proxy, 
              "https" : https_proxy, 
            }

url = "https://api.ipify.org"

r = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies)

print(r.text)
```
